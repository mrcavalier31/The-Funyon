      <p>Welcome to my totally serious journalism website.
         It looks like a newspaper if you squint hard enough.

          I kept the design simple and mobile first like the instructions told me to.</p>

        <h2>Local Cat Sanctuary Proves Disabled Cats Can Still Outrun Sadness</h2>
        <img src="images/catstory.jpg" alt="Cat with wheelchair at the sanctuary">
        <p>I went to this little cat sanctuary that helps disabled cats and honestly 
          it felt like walking into a fever dream. A volunteer showed me how they 
          build these mini wheelchairs and the cats just take off like they remembered they have places to be. 
          My favorite cat is named Captain Whiskerwheel and he drifted around a corner and then cuddled my shoe like it was a trophy. 
          The staff said their goal is simple: fewer sad meows, more zoomies. 
          I believe them because I saw a cat reverse park like a pro next to a food bowl.</p>

        <h2>NASA Accidentally Launches Manatee Into Orbit, Calls It “A Learning Experience”</h2>
        <img src="images/manateestory.jpg" alt="A manatee floating in colorful outer space">
        <p>According to a press thing I skimmed, the manatee rolled onto a platform labelled “not a rocket” and then it was a rocket actually. 
          Astronauts report the manatee is chill and keeps bumping into buttons that make nice beeping sounds.
           NASA says they will bring it home after “a few laps,” which sounds fair because space is basically a giant lazy river.
            If this goes well, they might try a turtle next.</p>
